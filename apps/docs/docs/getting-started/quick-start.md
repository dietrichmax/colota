# Quick Start

Minimal setup to start tracking:

2. Grant location permissions — select **Precise location** and **Allow all the time**
3. Disable battery optimization for Colota in Android settings
4. Press **Start Tracking**
5. View live coordinates on the dashboard

The app works completely offline. Server setup is optional.
